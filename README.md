February 2019

The goal of this project was to build a model that would take in features of a song provided by Spotiy's API to then predict what genre it belongs to. Choosing six generic genres defined by curated spotify playlists, 6000 songs were used to train the model. The main steps where:

1. [Obtain the features of a song in a playlist and create dataframes](https://github.com/blakespencer/classifying-genre/blob/master/Spotify_api.ipynb)
2. Train a model being able to predict
3. Link Spotiy's API to try out the model on any song in their library

Each of the links above is a Jupyter Notebook file with Python code to complete each step.
